<h2>Iza Ławniczak</h2>

I'm known as Sedna, my main interests include creating outstanding visuals, elegant code solutions and I can always be distracted with some computer history. Suprisingly, as a student of Computer Science at Wroclaw University of Science and Technology, I actually enjoy programming.
